# Nitro-Generator-AND-Checker (Scroll down to see videos + setup tutorials)

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED MALICIOUSLY TO STEAL OTHER USERS NITROS. WHAT YOU DO IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY 

Generates random nitro codes then checks them with the discord api.

To use : `pip install -r requirements.txt` (I have made the program do pip installs automatically if a module is missing) **MAY TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO STARTUP**

Then run Generator.py and input 1 or GEN to generate, or 2 or CHECK to check. The program fetches proxies automatically.

## New to python? - make sure to download python 3.9.0 - some later versions won't work
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

Creation and checking:

In this video I only ran it for a few seconds, but I've got a few valid codes out of this (did have to leave it running for a while). 

On a good quality pc, getting 5-10 THOUSAND codes a second is possible, and checking them fast is also a possibility (you just need good wifi & proxies)

Valid codes are saved to valid.txt 



## TODO
1. Thread nitro creation (it's currently on 1 thread and going insanely fast)
2. Add more proxy sources
3. Speed up checking
4. Add notifications for valid codes
5. Claim valid codes automatically
